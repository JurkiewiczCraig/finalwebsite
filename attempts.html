<h1>Experience Builder</h1>
<p class = "home">Experience Builder is an ESRI product that allows for the creation of web
apps using a drag-and-drop app builder. In pursuing our problem statement's objective of 
creating some complex apps that would be useful to people with an existing understanding of walkability, 
the group created an Experience Builder app that does several things. First, it displays a map of the 
core-based statistical areas in the state of Missouri along with a map of the EPA's final walkability index, 
with a slider allowing for a direct comparison of the two maps. This allows for quick observation of 
walkability in different CBSAs. Next, it shows a table that ranks census block groups within the state 
from most to least walkable, with the components of the index and the block group's associated CBSA also 
listed. When an entry is clicked, the map zooms in on the selected block group. In addition to this, when a 
block group is clicked on the map, a chart element on the right reads out the employment mix within that 
block group as a pie chart. While this information wouldn't make much sense to a person unfamiliar with 
walkability indexes, someone familiar with what the numbers mean could use this app to come to quick 
conclusions about relative walkability and the influence of employment mix on walkability indexes in Missouri. 
Finally, we developed a mobile layout that placed several of the widgets inside a widget controller element, 
allowing for use on phones and computers.</p>
<p class = "home">It was decided to exclude this effort from the final delivery for several reasons. For one, 
the mobile layout needs work in order to bring it to full usability. The main view works well, but the 
widgets display in a way that makes them somewhat unattractive and difficult to utilize as fully intended. As well, 
there are some awkward limitations to Experience Builder, such as an inability to round numbers in tables that 
gives ours a rather unprofessional appearance. It was also noted that some of the documentation feels relatively 
unclear even to someone with experience in ArcGIS Online, which lead to some tasks taking longer than expected for a 
drag-and-drop app builder. Finally, there has been some bugginess encountered, such as the map not displaying the first 
block group in the table despite the data being present and not filtered out. As we were nearing the end of our development 
time, it was decided to shelve this aspect of the project rather than improving it to the point where it could be usable. 
If picked back up, future work could include fixing the mobile layout so that it displays properly, rounding some of the data 
directly in the web map to limit the significant digits displayed, and exploring the app until the source of the block group bug 
is found.</p>

<h1> Leaflet</h1>
<p class = "home">Leaflet is an open source javascript library for desktop as well as mobile-friendly 
	interactive maps.  For a possible solution to our problem statement
	, our team attempted to create a web map (keeping all elements of the map as open source as possible)
	to show off walkability index's within the United States.  
	This would allow members of the public, as well as cuty planners
	to get a better understanding of how walkable their surrounding neighborhoods 
	are, all without the use of purchasing any Esri Licenses.  The final
	map that was created was able to show off how walkable areas of New York
	City area based on individual census blocks.  With each census block 
	being outlined, with it's individual walkability score being outlined when 
	the user hovered over the area with their mouse.
	</p>

	<p class = "home">This process involved several steps, from laying down a greyscale basemap (taken from https://github.com/Zverik/leaflet-grayscale?tab=readme-ov-file), to 
	taking data from ArcGIS Pro, clipping it down to only showcase the data from New York City, and converting it into a GeoJSON format in ArcGIS Pro and changing the file name to a .js</P>

	<img src="images/arcgisproNewYork.jpg" alt="Screenshot of how I used ArcGIS Pro to convert a clipped feature layer into a GeoJSon Format" style="width:100%;min-height:350px;max-height:300px;">

	<p class = "home">From there, the data was then brought into GitHub and a variable was assigned to the GeoJSon file.  There the data was brought into the map, laying ontop of the previously created greyscale map</P>
	<img src="images/jsonvariable.jpg" alt="assigning the GeoJSon data to a variable" style="width:100%;height:100%;">
 
	<p class = "home">After the layer was brought in, interactivity was introduced, by having the individual census block become highlighted whenver the mouse
	was hovering over the area, as well as a small info window to showcase what the individual walkability score of that area was</p>
	<img src="images/highlight.jpg" alt="Screenshot code used to highlight census block data when the mouse hovers over it" style="width:100%;min-height:350px;max-height:300px;">
	<p class = "home">A geolocator was added to the map, to allow for users to walk around the area and see the walkability scores of their individual areas area 
	as they walk around the city</p>

      <h2>What Worked Well</h2>
     <ul>
        <li>Using Open Source data meant I didn't need to fuss to API keys and could manipulate the data as I saw fit</li>
        <li>Easy to implement map on both desktop and mobile device for use</li>
	<li>Tons of literature, user guides, tutorials and instructionals on how to work with Leaflet freely available online </li>
        <li>Relatively easy to pick up for anyone who has basic skills in coding </li>
	<li>Can easily be worked on collaboratively as a group in Github and VSCode</li>

    <div class="column" style="background-color:rgb(110, 104, 104);">
      <h2>What Went wrong</h2>
	    <ul>
      <li>Limitations on file size when using GeoJSon data, required a lot of time cutting down on data to ensure it would
fit into GitHub as well ensuring the file itself could be modified for use</li>
	<li>Required more time than anticipated to relearn HTML, CSS and Java when going over the online tutorials </li>
      <li>Limited interactivity and capabilities when compared to Esri Web Maps, would have been able
      to create similar level of interactivity using  proprietary sources with half as much time being spent on creating them </li>
    <li>With the project timeline, was only able to include one layer showcasing the walkability idnex, and wasn't able to include any indepth
    levels of interactivity (pop ups, search bars etc)</li>
	 
	    </ul>
    </div>
	  <div class="column" style="background-color:rgb(222, 209, 209)">
      <h2>Future Possibilies</h2>
		  <ul>>
		  <li> When working with larger datasets(such as the one we focused this project on) would
		  be better to not use GeoJSon data, and focus more on using Esri's API keys instead</li>
		<li>Future versions would include more functionality within the map, such as interactive pop ups and a search bar</li>
			  <li> As cities grow and adapt, their walkability scores change, so this map could easily be updated 
			  as time goes on and more and more data becomes available</li>
			  <li>Future iterations of this potential solution would include several layers showcasing the four main 
			  factors associated with calculating the walkability index and have users comapre and 
			  contrast between them</li>
