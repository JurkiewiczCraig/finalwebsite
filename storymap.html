<h1>StoryMaps</h1>
<p class = "home">StoryMaps is an ESRI app that allows for the creation of interactive digital presentations that can present maps and other information in easily-accessible, 
user-friendly ways. As our problem statement involved creating user-friendly maps that introduce walkability factors to those with little understanding of the subject, StoryMaps 
immediately jumped out as a potential solution. The StoryMap created by our group breaks down the EPA's walkability index into its component factors and displays them across multiple 
geographies: the United States as a whole, the City of Joplin, Missouri, and the City of Austin, Texas. In addition to displaying the four main factors themselves (intersection density, 
distance to transit, employment mix, and employment-housing mix), the StoryMap also shows some comparisons and relationships between other data present in the index layers. For example, there is 
a comparison between zero-car households and low-wage employees for Joplin that shows where there might be many low-wage employees whose mobility is limited by a lack of personal transport. As one 
progresses through the presentation, text annotations explain each walkability factor and comment on the spatial patterns present in the data.</p>

      <h2>What Worked Well</h2>
     <ul>
        <li>Very easy to create a nice-looking layout.</li>
        <li>User-friendly design when fully implemented; the person reading needs little to no GIS knowledge to navigate.</li>
        <li>Easy to present multiple web maps in quick succession.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    
    <div class="column" style="background-color:rgb(110, 104, 104);">
      <h2>What Went Wrong</h2>
        <ul>
      	  <li>Difficult to collaborate, can't be edited by more than one user.</li>
	  <li>Forgot to limit fields in webmap pop-ups, rendering them very hard to navigate due to data volume.</li>  
	</ul>
    </div>
	  <div class="column" style="background-color:rgb(222, 209, 209)">
      <h2>Future Possibilities</h2>
         <ul>
	  <li>Add more pages comparing different variables to one another.</li>
	  <li>Add pages displaying factors for a truly rural area.</li>  
	  <li>Limit fields in webmap pop-ups for greater usability.</li>
