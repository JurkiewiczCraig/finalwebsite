<h1> Leaflet</h1>
<p class = "home">Leaflet is an open source javascript library for mobile-friendly 
	interactive maps.  For a possible solution to our problem statement
	, our team attempted to create a web map (without the use of any API)
	to show off walkability index's within the united states.  
	This map would include a geolocator as well so users 
	could walk around their own neighborhood and see how well
	their walkability indexes compare to other areas.  Below we 
	have a list of what worked well with this potential solution and what issues came up.  Along with potential ideas 
of what other things could be implemented in future designs </p>

<div class="row">
    <div class="column" style="background-color:#aaa;">
      <h2>Positives</h2>
     <ul>
        <li>Open source</li>
        <li>Mobile and Desktop Use</li>
        <li>Anyone has the ability to edit/manipulate the data if they wanted to </li>
        <li>Relatively easy to pick up for anyone who has basic skills in coding </li>
	<li>Can easily be worked on collaboratively</li>
    </ul>
    </div>
    
    <div class="column" style="background-color:#bbb;">
      <h2>Negatives</h2>
	    <ul>
      <li>Limited file size with GeoJSon data</li>
      <li>Limited interactivity and capabilities when compared to Esri Web Maps</li>
      <li>Requires prior knowledge of coding with HTML, CSS and Java</li>
      <li>Data is open to the public, so would need to assess data input priot to bringing in to ensure security</li>
      <li>If more time was alotted for the project, some other factors could have been involved, including more data being presented along with web layers</li>
    <li>With project timeline, was only able to include one layer showcasing the walkability idnex, future attempts with more time would allow the team 
    to add in more layers, search functions and other aspects to the map to make it more interactive</li>
