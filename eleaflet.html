<h1> Leaflet</h1>
<p>Leaflet is an open source javascript library for mobile-friendly interactive maps.  For a possible solution to our problem statement, our team attempted to create a web map (without the use of any API) to show off walkability index's within the united states.  This map would include a geolocator as well so civillians could walk around their own neighborhood and see how well their walkability indexes compare to other areas.  Below we have a list compiled of what worked well for this potential solution and what could be improved upon</p>
<div class = "leafletlink">
    <button class="leafletbutton"><a href="walkability.html">Check out our Leaflet Map</a></button>
 
<div class="row">
    <div class="column" style="background-color:#aaa;">
      <h2>Positives</h2>
     <ul>
        <li>Open source</li>
        <li>Mobile and Desktop Use</li>
        <li>Anyone has the ability to edit/manipulate and create their own version</li>
        <li>Can earily update map as new data becomes avialable</li>
    </ul>
    </div>
    
    <div class="column" style="background-color:#bbb;">
      <h2>Negatives</h2>
      <li>Limited file size with GeoJSon data</li>
      <li>Limited interactivity and capabilities when compared to Esri Web Maps</li>
      <li>Requires prior knowledge of coding with HTML, CSS and Java</li>
      <li>Data is open to the public, data is not as secure when compared to other software solutions</li>
      <li>If more time was alotted for the project, some other factors could have been involved, including more data being presented along with web layers</li>
      <li>Hard to get full grasp of capabilities with geolocator, unless you're in the area where the data is, the map isn't as functional as it should be</li>
    </ul>
