<h1> Leaflet</h1>
<p class = "home">Leaflet is an open source javascript library for mobile-friendly 
	interactive maps.  For a possible solution to our problem statement
	, our team attempted to create a web map (without the use of any API)
	to show off walkability index's within the united states.  
	This map would include a geolocator as well so users 
	could walk around their own neighborhood and see how well
	their walkability indexes compare to other areas.  Below we 
	have a list of what worked well with this potential solution and what issues came up.  Along with potential ideas 
of what other things could be implemented in future designs </p>

<div class = "leafletbutton">
    <a href="walkability.html">Check out our Leaflet Map </a>
	</div>
	
<div class="row">
    <div class="column" style="background-color:rgb(222, 209, 209);">
      <h2>What Worked Well</h2>
     <ul>
        <li>Using Open Source data meant I didn't need to fuss to API keys and could manipulate the data as I saw fit</li>
        <li>Map was usable on both desktop and mobile for users</li>
        <li>Relatively easy to pick up for anyone who has basic skills in coding </li>
	<li>Can easily be worked on collaboratively as a group in Github and VSCode</li>
    </ul>
    </div>
    
    <div class="column" style="background-color:rgb(110, 104, 104);">
      <h2>What Went wrong</h2>
	    <ul>
      <li>Limitations on file size when using GeoJSon data, required a lot of time cutting down on data to ensure it would
fit into GitHub as well ensuring the file itself could be modified for use</li>
	<li>Required more time than anticipated to relearn HTML, CSS and Java when going over the online tutorials </li>
      <li>Limited interactivity and capabilities when compared to Esri Web Maps, would have been able
      to create similar level of interactivity using  proprietary sources with half as much time being spent on creating them </li>
    <li>With the project timeline, was only able to include one layer showcasing the walkability idnex, and wasn't able to include any indepth
    levels of interactivity (pop ups, search bars etc)</li>
	 
	    </ul>
    </div>
	  <div class="column" style="background-color:rgb(222, 209, 209)">
      <h2>Future Possibilies</h2>
		  <ul>>
		  <li> When working with larger datasets(such as the one we focused this project on) would
		  be better to not use GeoJSon data, and focus more on using Esri's API keys instead</li
		<li>Future versions would include more functionality within the map, such as interactive pop ups and a search bar</li>
			  <li> As cities grow and adapt, their walkability scores change, so this map could easily be updated 
			  as time goes on and more and more data becomes available</li>
			  <li>Future iterations of this potential solution would include several layers showcasing the four main 
			  factors associated with calculating the walkability index and have users comapre and 
			  contrast between them</li>
