    <h6>Why Dashboard?</h6>
    <div class="steps">Dashboards are composed of configurable elements, such as maps, lists, charts, gauges, indicators, and tables. Most elements are data driven and thus makes it ideal to showcase the walkability index factors in a way that the intended audience can understand.</div>
	<table>
		<tr>
		  <th>Positives</th>
		  <th>Negatives</th>
		</tr>
		<tr>
		  <td>Performance when large datasets are used</td>
		  <td>Limited Customization which further requires arcade coding</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
		  <td>Customization of layouts and themes</td>
		  <td>Requires time to explore complex configurations</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
		  <td>Accessibility from any device</td>
		  <td>Not available without internet connection</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
		  <td>Integration with other ArcGIS tools and data sources</td>
		  <td>Needs subscription/lisence</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
		  <td>Ability to integrate real-time data</td>
		  <td></td>
		</tr>
	  </table>
 <h6>What was intresting?</h6>
 <div class="steps">The most intresting part to work on this dashboard was to colorcode the text in the list with the colors assigned for the respective walkability classification using arcade coding.</div>

 <div class="steps">The dashboard was designed for mobile devices too and had arranged the necessary parameters.</div>
