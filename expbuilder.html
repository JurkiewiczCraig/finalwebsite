<h1>Experience Builder</h1>
<p class = "home">Experience Builder is an ESRI product that allows for the creation of web
apps using a drag-and-drop app builder. In pursuing our problem statement's objective of 
creating some complex apps that would be useful to people with an existing understanding of walkability, 
the group created an Experience Builder app that does several things. First, it displays a map of the 
core-based statistical areas in the state of Missouri along with a map of the EPA's final walkability index, 
with a slider allowing for a direct comparison of the two maps. This allows for quick observation of 
walkability in different CBSAs. Next, it shows a table that ranks census block groups within the state 
from most to least walkable, with the components of the index and the block group's associated CBSA also 
listed. When an entry is clicked, the map zooms in on the selected block group. In addition to this, when a 
block group is clicked on the map, a chart element on the right reads out the employment mix within that 
block group as a pie chart. While this information wouldn't make much sense to a person unfamiliar with 
walkability indexes, someone familiar with what the numbers mean could use this app to come to quick 
conclusions about relative walkability and the influence of employment mix on walkability indexes in Missouri. 
Finally, we developed a mobile layout that placed several of the widgets inside a widget controller element, 
allowing for use on phones and computers.</p>
<p class = "home">It was decided to exclude this effort from the final delivery for several reasons. For one, 
the mobile layout needs work in order to bring it to full usability. The main view works well, but the 
widgets display in a way that makes them somewhat unattractive and difficult to utilize as fully intended. As well, 
there are some awkward limitations to Experience Builder, such as an inability to round numbers in tables that 
gives ours a rather unprofessional appearance. It was also noted that some of the documentation feels relatively 
unclear even to someone with experience in ArcGIS Online, which lead to some tasks taking longer than expected for a 
drag-and-drop app builder. Finally, there has been some bugginess encountered, such as the map not displaying the first 
block group in the table despite the data being present and not filtered out. As we were nearing the end of our development 
time, it was decided to shelve this aspect of the project rather than improving it to the point where it could be usable.</p>

	    <ul>
      <li>Unclear documentation regarding certain features, such as how to properly connect different widgets to one another.</li>
      <li>Some persistent bugginess. For example, the first block group in the table refuses to display on the map.</li>
      <li>Missing features, such as the ability to round off numbers within a table.</li>
