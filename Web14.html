 <h1>Showcasing the EPA's Walkability Index</h1>
<p class = "subtitle">For Citizens and City Planners alike</p>
<h2>Ideal</h2>
<p class = "home">Create a user friendly interactive web platform that display and inform members of the public on factors that are involved with creating a pedestrian friendly walkable city</p>

<h2>Reality</h2>
<p class = "home">The general public and city planning staff don't have readily-accessible, user-friendly data when it comes to the factors that influence walkability   </p>
<h2>Consequences</h2>
<p class = "home">If the public lacks knowledge of the factors that go into creating a pedestrian-friendly city, they wonâ€™t be able to offer useful feedback when city officials make or consider making changes to policy. As well, the city officials can't make accurate decisions without a full understanding of the factors that influence walkability in their area and a way to display those factors. </p>
<h2>Proposal</h2>
<p class = "home">To create interactive web applications that inform the public and city officials of factors that are taken into account when creating a walkability index. Some of these apps will be very user-friendly and focused on the public/less-informed city staff, while others will be more complex and detailed, with those being focused more towards city staff with experience in planning and some pre-existing knowledge of walkability.</p>
<h2>Technology Explored</h2>
<p class = "home">AGOL, ArcGIS Dashboards, Storymaps, Leaflet, Experience Builder </p>
